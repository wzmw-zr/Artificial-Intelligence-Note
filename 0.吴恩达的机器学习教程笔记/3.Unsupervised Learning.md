# Unsupervised Learning and Clustering Algorithm

## 一、Definition of Unsupervised Learning

Given a data set and we don't know what each data point is, then we try to find some structure in the data,  sometimes this means break these data into some separate clusters, which is called Clustering Algorithm.

In unsupervised learning, we don't give the correct answer for the examples in the data set.
