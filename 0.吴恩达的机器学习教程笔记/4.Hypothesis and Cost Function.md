# Hypothesis and Cost Function

## 一、Hypothesis 

Hypothesis function is the function of the model, which can be generated and optimized by the learning algorithm.

Hypothesis sometimes means the function mapping the variable data in the data set to Estimated value.



## 二、Linear Regression

Linear function is predicting that y is some straight line function of x,  like $y = h_{\theta}(x) = \theta_0+\theta_1x$

The model above also called univariate linear model.



## 三、Cost Function

Cost function is used to find the best possible function to fit the data.

Take Linear regression as example, we are trying to choose $\theta_0,\theta_1$， so that $h_{\theta}(x)$ is close to y for our training examples  $(x,y)$.

We tend to use square difference or the changed function according to square difference of the training set between the prediction of the hypothesis as the cost function, then we need to get the optimized function of cost function. 

Here is a Cost Function:
$$
\frac{1}{2m}(\sum_{i = 1}^{m}(h(x_i)-y_i)^2)
$$
